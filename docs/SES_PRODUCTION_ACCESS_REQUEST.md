```
Tyche Finance is a personal finance management application that helps users 
track expenses, manage budgets, and optimize credit card debt payoff strategies 
using AI-powered recommendations.

We use Amazon SES exclusively for the following transactional emails:

1. Email Verification Codes
   - When: New users create accounts
   - Purpose: Verify email ownership and prevent spam accounts
   - Frequency: Once per new user signup

2. Password Reset Codes
   - When: Users request password reset
   - Purpose: Secure account recovery
   - Frequency: As needed (estimated 5-10% of users monthly)

3. Security Notifications
   - When: Suspicious login attempts or account changes
   - Purpose: Protect user accounts
   - Frequency: Rare, security events only

All emails are opt-in by design - users must explicitly sign up for our service 
to receive any communications. We do not send marketing emails, promotional 
content, or unsolicited messages.

Expected Email Volume:
- Current (Development): 10-50 emails/day
- 3 Months: 200-500 emails/day
- 12 Months: 1,000-3,000 emails/day

All emails include clear branding, contact information, and are sent from our 
verified identity: app.tyche.financial@gmail.com
