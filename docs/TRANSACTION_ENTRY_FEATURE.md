# Transaction Entry Feature

## Overview

Added full transaction entry functionality to the Spending Dashboard, allowing users to add both **one-off income** (like garage sales) and **expenses** without modifying their budget.

## Key Distinction

### Budget vs Transactions

**Budget** (`/budget` page):
- **Planned/Projected** income and expenses
- Sets your financial targets for the month
- Example: "I expect $5,000 salary + $500 side income"
- Creates your spending categories and limits

**Transactions** (`/spending` page):
- **Actual** income and expenses that occurred
- Records what really happened
- Example: "I sold a jacket for $10 in a garage sale"
- Tracks against your budget

## Use Case Example

**Scenario**: You already created your January budget with $5,000 projected income. Then you have a garage sale and sell a jacket for $10.

**Solution**: 
1. Go to `/spending` (Spending Dashboard)
2. Click "Add Transaction" button
3. Toggle to "💵 Income"
4. Fill in:
   - Date: When you sold it
   - Description: "Garage sale - jacket"
   - Amount: $10
   - Notes: "Old leather jacket from closet"
5. Click "💵 Add Income"

**Result**:
- Your budget remains $5,000 (planned income)
- Your actual income shows $5,010 (budget + one-off sale)
- Net income calculation updates automatically
- Transaction appears in transaction list

## Technical Implementation

### API Integration

```typescript
POST /v1/transactions
Authorization: Bearer {idToken}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "date": "2025-01-15T12:00:00Z",
  "description": "Garage sale - jacket",
  "amount": 10.00,
  "category": "income",
  "isIncome": true,
  "isEssential": false,
  "notes": "Old leather jacket from closet"
}
```

### State Management

```typescript
const [transactionForm, setTransactionForm] = useState({
  date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
  description: '',
  amount: '',
  category: 'miscellaneous',
  isIncome: false,
  isEssential: false,
  notes: '',
});
```

### Form Submission Flow

2. Validate required fields (description, amount > 0)
3. Create payload with proper date formatting
4. POST to `/v1/transactions` with auth token
5. Handle success/error responses
6. Reset form and close modal
7. Reload analytics and transaction list
8. New transaction appears immediately
