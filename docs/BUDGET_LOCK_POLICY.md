# Budget Lock Policy - Implementation Summary

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** (Deployed January 2025)

---

## Overview

Implemented a **24-hour budget edit window** with educational messaging to encourage financial accountability and accurate tracking. After 24 hours from creation, budgets become read-only to prevent retroactive editing that would compromise data integrity.

---

## Key Features

### 1. **24-Hour Edit Window**

**Logic**:
```typescript
const isEditWindowExpired = existingBudget && existingBudget.createdAt
  ? (Date.now() - new Date(existingBudget.createdAt).getTime()) > 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
  : false;
```

**Behavior**:
- ‚úÖ Editable for **24 hours** after creation
- üîí Becomes **read-only** after 24 hours
- üëÅÔ∏è Historical budgets viewable in **Analytics** section (coming soon)

---

### 2. **Current Month Lock**

Both Budget Setup and Spending Dashboard are **locked to the current month only**:

**Budget Setup Page**:
```typescript
const currentMonth = getCurrentMonth(); // Read-only, no user control
```

**Spending Dashboard**:
```typescript
const currentMonth = getCurrentMonth(); // Read-only, no user control
```

**Rationale**:
- Prevents users from creating budgets in the past or future
- Encourages users to set budgets at the start of each month
- Historical viewing reserved for Analytics page (cleaner UX)

---

### 3. **Educational Messaging**

**Info Notice** (Always shown - Blue banner):
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è Budget Lock Policy

You can edit your budget for 24 hours after creation. After that, it becomes 
read-only to help you stay committed to your financial plan. Unplanned expenses 
(medical, car repairs, etc.) should be tracked as transactions to help you plan 
for emergency savings in future budgets.
```

**Warning Notice** (Shown when locked - Orange banner):
```
üîí Budget Locked

This budget was created more than 24 hours ago and can no longer be edited. 
This policy helps maintain accurate financial tracking and encourages commitment 
to your planned budget. View historical budgets in the Analytics section.
```

---

### 4. **Visual Feedback**

**Locked Form State** (CSS):
```css
.budget-form-locked {
  opacity: 0.6;
  pointer-events: none;
  user-select: none;
  filter: grayscale(40%);
}
```

**Notice Banners**:
- Blue left border (info) - `border-left: 4px solid #3182CE`
- Orange left border (warning) - `border-left: 4px solid #DD6B20`
- Icon + Title + Description layout
- Responsive padding and spacing

**Disabled Controls**:
- Save button disabled when `isEditWindowExpired`
- All form inputs have `readOnly={isEditWindowExpired}`
- Form wrapper has `.budget-form-locked` class

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
```typescript
// Budget Setup Page
const [existingBudget, setExistingBudget] = useState<any>(null);
const currentMonth = getCurrentMonth(); // Format: "YYYY-MM"

// Calculate edit window
const isEditWindowExpired = existingBudget && existingBudget.createdAt
  ? (Date.now() - new Date(existingBudget.createdAt).getTime()) > 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
  : false;

// Conditional rendering
{isEditWindowExpired && (
  <div className="warning-notice">
    <div className="notice-icon">üîí</div>
    <div>
      <h4>Budget Locked</h4>
      <p>This budget was created more than 24 hours ago...</p>
    </div>
  </div>
)}

// Form wrapper
<div className={isEditWindowExpired ? 'budget-form-locked' : ''}>
  {/* All form inputs here */}
</div>

// Disabled save button
<button
  onClick={saveBudget}
  disabled={isEditWindowExpired || loading || totalIncomeNum === 0 || discretionaryIncome < 0}
>
  {loading ? 'Saving...' : 'Save Budget'}
</button>
```

### API Integration
```typescript
// Budget API endpoint (already deployed)
GET /v1/budgets/:month     // Fetch budget for specific month
POST /v1/budgets           // Create new budget
PUT /v1/budgets/:budgetId  // Update existing budget (checks 24hr window in backend)
DELETE /v1/budgets/:id     // Delete budget (disabled after 24hr)

// Spending API endpoint (already deployed)
GET /v1/spending/analytics/:month  // Fetch spending data for month
```
