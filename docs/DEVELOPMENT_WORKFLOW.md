# Development Workflow & Best Practices

**Created:** January 17, 2025  
**Purpose:** Standard procedures for development, documentation, and task completion

---

## Todo List Management

### ‚úÖ When Marking a Todo as Complete

**ALWAYS update the following documentation files:**

1. **README.md** - Update feature list, deployment status, or getting started guide
2. **CHANGELOG.md** - Add entry describing what was completed and when
3. **Feature-specific docs** - Update relevant technical documentation:
   - Implementation guides
   - API documentation
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Schema definitions

### Documentation Update Checklist

Before marking a todo as complete, verify:

- [ ] README.md updated (if user-facing feature)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md has new entry
- [ ] Technical docs updated (implementation details, schemas, etc.)
- [ ] Code comments added for complex logic
- [ ] Examples/usage added to docs
- [ ] Related files cross-referenced

### Example: Completing "Deploy Budget Tables" Todo

**Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Deploy infrastructure (tables created)
2. ‚úÖ Verify deployment (tables ACTIVE)
3. üìù Update **CHANGELOG.md**:
   ```markdown
   ## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-17
   ### Added
   - 4 new DynamoDB tables for budget/spending management
   - Budget schema documentation
   - TypeScript types for budgets, transactions, analytics
   ```
4. üìù Create **BUDGET_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md** (deployment details)
5. üìù Update **README.md** (add budget features to roadmap)
6. ‚úÖ Mark todo as complete

## Documentation Standards

### When to Create New Documentation

**Create new doc files for:**
- Major feature implementations (e.g., `CARDS_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`)
- Complex technical designs (e.g., `BUDGET_SPENDING_SCHEMA.md`)
- Deployment summaries (e.g., `BUDGET_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md`)
- Integration guides (e.g., `AGENTKIT_INTEGRATION.md`)
- Testing procedures (e.g., `AUTH_TESTING_GUIDE.md`)

**Update existing docs for:**
- Minor feature additions
- Bug fixes
- Configuration changes
- Performance improvements

### Documentation File Naming

**Format:** `[FEATURE]_[TYPE].md`

**Examples:**
- `CARDS_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation details
- `BUDGET_SPENDING_SCHEMA.md` - Database schema
- `AWS_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Setup instructions
- `AUTH_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Testing procedures
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Deployment steps

### Documentation Structure

**Every documentation file should include:**

```markdown
# Title

**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** [Design Phase | In Development | Completed | Archived]
**Related:** [Links to related docs]

## Overview
Brief description of the feature/system

## [Relevant Sections]
- Architecture
- Implementation
- API Reference
- Examples
- Testing
- Troubleshooting

## Related Documentation
- [Other docs this references]
```

---

## CHANGELOG.md Standards

### Format

```markdown
## [Version] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- New features, endpoints, pages

### Changed
- Modifications to existing features

### Fixed
- Bug fixes, error corrections

### Removed
- Deprecated features

### Security
- Security-related changes
```

### When to Add CHANGELOG Entries

**ALWAYS for:**
- New features (pages, API endpoints, UI components)
- Infrastructure changes (new tables, services, deployments)
- Breaking changes (API changes, schema migrations)
- Major bug fixes

**Optional for:**
- Minor styling tweaks
- Documentation-only changes
- Refactoring (if no user impact)

---

## README.md Maintenance

### Sections to Update

1. **Features List** - Add new features as they're completed
2. **Getting Started** - Update setup steps if changed
3. **Deployment Status** - Mark features as deployed/in-progress
4. **Tech Stack** - Add new libraries or services
5. **API Endpoints** - Update endpoint list

### Feature Status Indicators

Use emoji to show status:
- ‚úÖ Complete and deployed
- üöß In development
- üìã Planned
- ‚ùå Deprecated/removed

---

## Git Commit Messages

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
